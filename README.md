# Wordle-Solver
Helps diminish the amount of tries and time it takes for users to complete Wordle; a puzzle game based on guessing a five letter word in 6 tries or less.

letterList.txt is a list of over 5700 five letter words from the English dictionary. I highly doubt any other words would be in Wordle that aren't in this txt file.
